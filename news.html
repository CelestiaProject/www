      <h3>Celestia 1.6.3</h3>
      <p>Version 1.6.3 of Celestia is now available for all supported systems. It fixes issues with 3DS models and location handling, macOS-specific problems such as re-adding support for OS X 10.7 to 10.9 and flickering edges on some GPUs, and fixes some issues with the executable name in celestia.desktop and a buffer overflow in the eclipser finder on Unix-based systems. The Bulgarian translation has been updated, and features from 1.7.0 have been backported, including location updates and allowing binary orbits to work without text sources. Celestia 1.6.3 is available for download from the <a href="download.html">download page</a>.</p>

        <h3>Fosshost is going EOL, here's what to expect</h3>
        <p>Our website is hosted by Fosshost, a website hosting project that caters to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects such as Celestia and many others. Just earlier today, Fosshost announced that their servers are going to shut down in the near future and they are going end-of-life. In their own words, from their website: <b>"At this time, Fosshost is deeply sorry to announce we are no longer able to continue offering our services. Due to circumstances outside of the control of the Fosshost volunteers, we are now in a situation where we cannot guarantee our servers will stay online, and in fact expect them to go offline shortly. Because of this, we strongly recommend all Fosshost tenants to backup their data immediately, and migrate elsewhere as soon as possible."</b></p>
        <p>Luckily, some people over at Fosshost started a new, similar project called <a href="https://radixproject.org/">Radix</a>. This is the most likely option for future hosting of the website. Even though Fosshost announced that their datacenters will be operational until at least the end of the year, they still recommend finding new hosting, and their servers may become unstable, so expect interruptions on the website. Once we are ready to move to Radix, the website will temporarily go offline. One of our Forum Admins, SevenSpheres, is currently attempting to archive as much of the Forums as he can, but it is <b style="font-weight: 600;">strongly recommended</b> that you backup any add-ons or pictures regardless. Once the website has been transferred, it will retain the same URL as it does now. Stay tuned on Celestia's socials (Primarily the Discord server, linked on the Forums at the top of the page).</p>
